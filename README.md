## Untagger üè∑Ô∏è

Untagger is a removal and full text extraction of HTML written in Swift heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/kohlschutter/boilerpipe">Boilerpipe</a>. Like Boilerpipe, Untagger provides algorithms to detect and remove the surplus "clutter" (boilerplate, templates) around the main textual content of a web page.

The algorithms used by the library are based on concepts of the paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1718487.1718542">"Boilerplate Detection using Shallow Text Features" by Christian Kohlsch√ºtter et al., presented at WSDM 2010</a> -- The Third ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining New York City, NY USA.
